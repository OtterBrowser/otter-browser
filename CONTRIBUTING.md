# How to contribute

If you want to help with the development of Otter Browser, please observe the following rules.

## Reporting bugs and feature requests

* Make sure that you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Check if the issue has already been reported (including closed tickets).
* Check list of [known upstream issues](https://github.com/OtterBrowser/otter-browser/wiki/Upstream-Bugs).
* If possible, try to reproduce the issue with current snapshot from relevant branch of the source code repository.
* Create a ticket for your issue.
* Describe the issue clearly and succinctly.
* In case of bug reports:
  * describe the steps required to reproduce issue,
  * attach a [backtrace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace) if you have any,
  * post details about your setup:
    * application version (for example, weekly 50 32 bit),
    * system version (for example, Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit),
    * Qt version (for example, Qt 5.4.0 MSVC 64 bit).

## Submitting patches

* Make sure that you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
* Ensure that nobody is currently working on the selected task (check if someone is assigned to the ticket or ask on *#otter-browser* at libera.chat).
* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Create a branch just for that task.
* Submit your changes as a pull request so they can be reviewed.
* Patiently wait for the review.

## Coding rules

* Use the [Allman coding style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style) with tabs for indentation.
* Follow a naming scheme that is consistent with the existing code.
* Use **const** as often as possible (both for local variables and method signatures).
* Wrap text correctly using [``QString``, ``QStringLiteral`` or ``QLatin1String``](http://woboq.com/blog/qstringliteral.html). Remember to use ``tr()`` for translateable texts.
* Avoid long lines but also try not to break up if-statements etc. Any good editor should be able to wrap long lines.
* Try to keep a proper order of methods in the source file (check existing code in case of doubt):
  * constructor(s),
  * destructor,
  * methods returning void (reimplementations of *Event methods and others should go first),
  * setters,
  * methods returning value (from pointers through data structures to primitive data types).
